# Katcode

The greatest code lang you will ever live with, Simple, fast to deploy, and easy to learn.

Deploying Katcode
- DM Katy on discord, User name @katy.the.kat for an authkey. But if you already had authkey, then you git this repo

Deploying an Katcode Repo
- Get started by git the katcode repo https://github.com/windows11-on-web/katcode
- then Deploy katcode file named "repo.katrepo" and writing katcode packages
- and then after you're done, Go deploy the repo.katrepo file to github [please put git on the end of the repo name to avoid katcode trying to find its authkey for katcode, If you want a verifed repo please go dm me via the username @katy.the.kat for a katrepo authkey]
- and then share the git url for anyone to use the repo and you're done

What are repos
- They are your life saver, Packages for katcode are in repos, Kinda like apt package manager in linux
